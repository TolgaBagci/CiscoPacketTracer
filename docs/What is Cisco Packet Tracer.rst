What is Cisco Packet Tracer?
==================

Cisco Packet Tracer is a simulation program used by Cisco to configure the necessary configurations before installing Router, Switch, Hub, or Security Devices on a real network.

Cisco Packet Tracer does not include only Cisco branded devices. You can find many network devices on the Packet Tracer.

If you are a network administrator or a student preparing for Cisco exams, I highly recommend you to use the Packet Tracer network simulator program.
